1) **Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.**  
No, I would not use a unit test to test the "message" feature of an app. This is because a unit test would not be enough to give me enough information about this feature, because typically a "message" involves multiple components of the application. Unit tests are best and meant for testing smaller individual parts of code, not meant for a full-fledged feature like this. It wouldn't give accurate or comprehensive results.

2) **Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.**  
Yes, I would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature of a messaging application. This is because this feature is smaller and more specific compared to the broad "message" feature in the previous question. Additionally, this feature would be handled locally, which is more suitable for a unit test.
